<p class="yf-1090901"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Sasol is making encouraging progress on our key priorities communicated at
    Capital Markets Day 2025 despite a challenging macro and operating environment with free cash flow after tax,
    interest and capital expenditure increasing by 75% to R12,6 billion. Earnings (pre-tax) were supported by
    non-recurring items, including the Transnet net cash settlement of R4,3 billion and the reduction in the
    environmental rehabilitation provision of R2,9 billion, offset by lower unrealised gains of R2 billion from the
    translation of monetary assets and liabilities and revaluation of derivatives (compared to R4,7 billion the prior
    year). This improvement was further supported by management actions in line with our goal to deliver sustainable
    long-term value to our stakeholders.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>
