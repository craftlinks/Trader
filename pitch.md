This project goal is to detect events with significant potential impact on the stock valuation of publicly traded healthcare companiesâ€”including those in pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and medical devices.

Key signals include:

- Announcements of clinical trial outcomes
- Updates on regulatory decisions or approvals
- Releases of financial performance data
- Disclosures of major investment activities
- News of mergers, acquisitions, or strategic partnerships


Insights from this monitoring will inform an LLM agent, guiding its stock trading strategies.
